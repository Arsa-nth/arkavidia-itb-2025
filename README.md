## Background
Data-driven decision making plays a crucial role in solving complex real-world problems.  
Through this competition, we explore how data science methodologies—ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning—can be applied to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models.

---

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the characteristics and patterns within the given dataset
- To perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- To develop and evaluate predictive models
- To interpret the results and provide actionable insights

---

## Methodology
Our general workflow consists of the following steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Understanding data distribution, correlations, and anomalies.
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handling missing values, feature transformation, and encoding.
3. **Model Development**  
   Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
4. **Evaluation and Analysis**  
   Comparing model performance and interpreting results.
